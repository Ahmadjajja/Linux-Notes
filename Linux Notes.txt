								---LINUX---



1) primary Objective

	a) Convenience(Windows and Macos)
	b) Throughput(Linux)
		~uses for executing number of tasks per unit time
		~Linux is faster than windows(Opening More than 1 tabs in browser)

2) Major Functionalities

	a) Resource Management

	~Resource management works when multiple users connected from a single machine like server.
	~Especially it use where parallel users connected from a machine.

	b) Process Management

	~If we have multiple applications/process running at a time like media player, browser, gaming app,
	OS manages it using CPU SCHEDULING

	c) Storage Management(Hard drive)
	
	~Store data in drive using file system.

	d) Memory Management(RAM)

	~All process first come in  RAM before execution.
	~RAM allocate memory and send it to CPU.
	~CPU executes the program/application

	e)Security Management
	
	~Operating System refers to specified steps or measures used to protect the OS from threats, viruses, 
	worms, malware or remote hacker intrusions.
	~Check the authentication.

3) why linux is better than WINDOWS for SERVERS?

	1)Free and Open Source 
 	
	~Linux is free and open source; we can see the source code used to create Linux(kernal).
	
	2)Stability and Reliability
	
	~Linux is Unix-based and Unix was origionally designed to provide an environment that's powerful, stable and reliable yet easy to use.
	Linux systems are widely known for their stability and reliability , many Linux servers on the internet have been running for years 
	without failure or even being restarted.

	3)Security 

	~Linux is without doubt the most secure kernal out there, making linux based operating systems secure and suitable for servers.
	
	4) Flexibility

	~Linux is so powerful and flexible. You can tune it to meet you server needs: it allows you to do whatever you want (if possible).
	You can install a GUI or simply operate your server via a terminal only.
	~ we  can make our own OS using linux kernal according to our requirements.
	
	5) Cost and maintenance
	~ Finally, the total cost of owning and maintaining a LINUX server is lower compared to windows server, in terms of licensing fess,
	software/hardware purchase and maintenance costs, system support services and administrative costs.

4) What is Kernal?
	~Kernal is core component of every operating system.We access our hardware through Kernal.Kernal works like bridge between hardware
	and our application.

5) Kernal and User Space
	~system memory or main divids in two parts:
	a)Kernal space
	b)User Space
		~space where processes of our application are running i.e processes like gaming application , media player or any other application etc.

example:-
	~For example when we are making an application, then the code of that application is in User Space. For application running,
	we needs kernal mode/kernal space to access hardware for running that application.
Note:-
	~we access Kernal space in User Space by user through System calls(C programming language functions).
	For example, User gives System Calls that we need this hardware. These System calls are available in C-Language.
	A standard library uses in linux for that calls is called GNUC-LIBRARY.


GNUC-LIBRARY:-    I think this library similar like #include<stdio.h>
	~This library contains multiple functions like print(), write() and many more permission methods like chMode(),pseudoCommand() etc.
	Through all these functions , we accesses Kernal Space from UserSpace.

6)File System
	~Linux organizes files using a hierarchical system.
	~Files are stored in directories and these directories can also contain other directories.
	~When you compare the Linux file-system to windows, you will find that there are no drive letters in Linux.

Commands part 1:
1) / -> Root command of linux.
2) ls -> This command means that to see all content of current(specified address) directory( / ).
3) cd home/ -> change directory from current directory to home directory.
4) ~ -> tilde sign means that comes to the home page of this user.
5) clear -> will clear terminal screen.
6) cd .. => Uses for to moving 1 step back
7) cd . => uses for exiting from current folder.

Note:-
	~we can't go to from current directory to that directory that is not nested of this current directory.

8) mkdir directoryName -> make directory/folder command means that this will create new directory/folder in this current directory/folder.
9) touch app.txt -> This will create app.txt file in this current directoy.
10) vi app.txt -> this command will Add or Edit this file            					//Important and deep Concept!
	~ i -> insert mode turn on using "i" command.
	~pressing esc button -> we press this button to move out from insert mode.    //Confusion cleared
	~pressing shift + colon -> we press this to save our file
	~w and q -> press w for write and then q for quit to quit from editor mode.   //Confusion cleared
11) cat app.txt-> this command print the all content in current file app.txt

note:- 
terminal support this vi editor to ADD or EDITS files.
After getting into editor we should need to switch to different modes like insert mode using i command.

Commands part 2:
12) cp app.txt /Desktop/cloud-native/ -> This command will create a copy of app.txt file in cloud-native directory/folder from current directory/folder.
13) mv app.txt /home/daniyal/Desktop/ -> This command will move app.txt file in Desktop directory/folder from current directory/folder.
14) rm app.txt -> This command will remove app.txt from current directory/folder.
15) man ls -> this command will provide the detail of specific(ls command).                  			//Important command
16) find /home/daniyal/Desktop/cloud-native-2/cli/ "app.txt*" -> This command will search our directory/folder or file.(* means how many files exist here with this name and search that files).
17) find /home/daniyal/Desktop/cloud-native-2/cli/ -name "app.txt" ->If app.txt exists in this directory then This command will return the path of that file. otherwise return nothing.
18) cd . => uses for exiting from current folder.
19) pwd => this command will show current path of the directory.


7)UBUNTU Installation Guide

Linux Flavours:-
	~Suci, fedora, genome, kaali and Ubuntu.
Ubuntu is easy to install, easy to use and update & support is much faster.

20) apt-get(attribute of apt) install <package-name> => this command will install the specified software through CMD.

note:- 
	linux is basically a multiuser Environment means that we can create multile users.
	we can remove "Permission denied" error by login through root user.

How we can access root user from normal user?

User Roles:-
	Two user roles:
		1)Normal User
			Any normal user can create, read and edit file.Normal user can't perform system changes or can't install dependencies.
			
		2)Super User
			Super user can create, read and edit any file and also make system changes without any permission error.

21) sudo su => by using this command will will login into our root user.

Note:-
	Again and Again login into root user for installation of any software is bad practice.

22) sudo => sudo command gains all root security privileges from Root user for Normal user.

23) sudo apt-get install python => This command will install python without any permission error.

Some ShortCut Keys
	~These are uses for our development fast.

Note:-
	1)sudo apt-get install python => For example,when we write g and press tab this will automatically complete the command.
	2) apt double press tab => This command uses for checking out all possibilities of apt. 
	3) ctrl + e => by using this command We can move our cursor to the last of our current command.
	4) arrow up =>we can see our last command
